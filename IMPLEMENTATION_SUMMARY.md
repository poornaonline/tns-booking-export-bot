# Implementation Summary: Address, Date, and Time Automation

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Metro Locations Lookup System

**File**: `src/web/automation.py`

**New Features**:
- Loads `metro-locations.json` on initialization
- Resolves short codes to full addresses
- Handles both short codes and full addresses
- Case-insensitive matching
- Graceful fallback if code not found

**Methods Added**:
```python
def _load_metro_locations(self) -> List[Dict]
def _resolve_address(self, location_code: str) -> str
```

**Example**:
```python
# Input: "NME"
# Output: "Metro Trains North Melbourne Maintenance Depot"

# Input: "123 Main Street"
# Output: "123 Main Street" (unchanged)
```

### 2. Address Field Automation

**Method Added**: `_fill_address_field(address: str, is_pickup: bool)`

**Features**:
- Clicks field to focus
- Types address with 100ms delay (triggers autocomplete)
- Waits for dropdown to appear
- Selects first matching option
- Continues even if dropdown fails

**Process**:
1. Find input field by placeholder text
2. Click to focus
3. Clear existing value
4. Type address character by character
5. Wait for autocomplete dropdown
6. Click first option in dropdown
7. Handle errors gracefully

### 3. Date and Time Automation

**Method Added**: `_fill_date_time(booking_date, booking_time)`

**Features**:
- Handles Excel Timestamp objects
- Supports multiple date formats
- Converts to dd/mm/yyyy format
- Removes readonly attribute from date field
- Fills time in HH:MM format

**Supported Date Formats**:
- `dd/mm/yyyy` → "04/09/2025"
- `yyyy-mm-dd` → "2025-09-04"
- `dd-mm-yyyy` → "04-09-2025"
- `mm/dd/yyyy` → "09/04/2025"
- Excel Timestamp objects

**Supported Time Formats**:
- `HH:MM` → "14:30"
- `H:MM` → "9:30"
- Excel time strings

### 4. Enhanced Booking Creation Flow

**Updated Method**: `start_booking_creation(valid_bookings: List[Dict])`

**New Flow**:
```
Step 1: Name Entry (existing)
├── Navigate to create-v2 page
├── Fill driver name
├── Wait for Next button to enable
└── Click Next

Step 2: Address, Date, Time (NEW)
├── Extract From/To/Date/Time from Excel
├── Resolve addresses using metro locations
├── Fill pickup address with autocomplete
├── Fill destination address with autocomplete
├── Fill date field
├── Fill time field
├── Wait for Next button to enable
└── Click Next

Step 3: Continue manually (for now)
```

## 📊 Data Flow

### Excel File Structure

The SILVERTOP Excel file has these columns:

| Column | Type | Example | Usage |
|--------|------|---------|-------|
| Date | Timestamp | 2025-09-04 | Converted to dd/mm/yyyy |
| Time | String | "02:09" | Used as HH:MM |
| Driver | String | "MAJCEN Dennis" | Used in Step 1 |
| From | String | "NME" | Resolved to pickup address |
| To | String | "CPS03O" | Resolved to destination address |
| Reason | String/NaN | nan | Not used yet |
| Shift | String | "1001" | Not used yet |

### Address Resolution Example

**From Excel**:
```
From: "NME"
To: "CPS03O"
```

**After Resolution**:
```
Pickup: "Metro Trains North Melbourne Maintenance Depot"
Destination: "CPS Metro Trains Calder Park Depot"
```

**In Browser**:
1. Types "Metro Trains North Melbourne Maintenance Depot"
2. Dropdown appears with matching addresses
3. Selects first option
4. Repeats for destination

## 🔧 Technical Details

### HTML Selectors Used

| Element | Selector | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Pickup Address | `input[placeholder="Pickup Address"]` | Find pickup field |
| Destination Address | `input[placeholder="Destination Address"]` | Find destination field |
| Dropdown Options | `.multiselect__option` | Find autocomplete options |
| Date Field | `input[type="text"][readonly]` | Find date input |
| Time Field | `input[data-maska]` | Find time input |
| Next Button | `button:has-text("Next"):not([disabled])` | Wait for enabled button |

### Timing and Delays

| Action | Delay | Reason |
|--------|-------|--------|
| After name entry | 2 seconds | Wait for page load |
| After field click | 0.5 seconds | Allow focus |
| Typing delay | 100ms per char | Trigger autocomplete |
| After typing | 2 seconds | Wait for dropdown |
| After selection | 1 second | Allow form update |
| After date/time | 1 second | Allow validation |

### Error Handling

**Graceful Degradation**:
- If metro locations file missing → Use codes as-is
- If short code not found → Use code as-is
- If dropdown doesn't appear → Continue with typed address
- If date parsing fails → Use original value
- If field not found → Log error and raise exception

**Logging Levels**:
- `INFO`: Successful operations, resolved addresses
- `WARNING`: Fallback scenarios, missing codes
- `ERROR`: Critical failures, exceptions

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Results

```bash
$ python3 run_tests.py
