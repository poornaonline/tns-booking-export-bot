# Bug Fixes: Multiselect Address Fields

## Issues Identified

### Issue 1: NME Code Not Resolving
**Error**: `WARNING - No address found for code 'NME', using as-is`

**Root Cause**: 
- The Excel file uses "NME" as a short code
- The `metro-locations.json` file doesn't have "NME" as a standalone code
- It has "NMED", "NMEC", "NMEP23", etc., but not "NME"

**Solution**: 
- Added partial matching logic to `_resolve_address()` method
- If exact match fails, tries to find codes that start with the input
- Requires minimum 3 characters to avoid false matches
- Example: "NME" now matches "NMED" â†’ "Metro Trains North Melbourne Maintenance Depot"

### Issue 2: Destination Address Field Hidden
**Error**: 
```
ERROR - Error filling Destination Address: Page.wait_for_selector: Timeout 10000ms exceeded.
Call log:
  - waiting for locator("input[placeholder=\"Destination Address\"]") to be visible
    25 Ã— locator resolved to hidden <input name="" type="text" tabindex="0" autocomplete="off" spellcheck="false" class="multiselect__input" aria-controls="listbox-null" placeholder="Destination Address"/>
```

**Root Cause**:
- The multiselect component uses a hidden input field
- The input only becomes visible when the multiselect container is clicked
- Previous code tried to find the input directly by placeholder, which failed
- After selecting pickup address, the destination input remains hidden until activated

**Solution**:
- Changed approach to interact with the multiselect container first
- Find all `.multiselect.address-select` elements (pickup is first, destination is second)
- Click on the multiselect container to activate it
- Then find the input field within that specific multiselect
- This makes the input visible and ready for interaction

## Code Changes

### 1. Enhanced Address Resolution

**File**: `src/web/automation.py`

**Method**: `_resolve_address()`

**Changes**:
```python
# Added partial matching after exact match fails
for location in self.metro_locations:
    for sc in location.get('shortCode', []):
        if sc.upper().startswith(code_upper) and len(code_upper) >= 3:
            address = location.get('address', '')
            logger.info(f"Resolved '{location_code}' to '{address}' (partial match with '{sc}')")
            return address
```

**Benefits**:
- âœ… Handles incomplete short codes (e.g., "NME" â†’ "NMED")
- âœ… Requires minimum 3 characters to avoid false matches
- âœ… Logs which code was matched for debugging
- âœ… Falls back to original code if no match found

### 2. Fixed Multiselect Interaction

**File**: `src/web/automation.py`

**Method**: `_fill_address_field()`

**Changes**:
```python
# Find all multiselect containers
multiselects = self.page.query_selector_all('.multiselect.address-select')

# First multiselect is pickup, second is destination
multiselect_index = 0 if is_pickup else 1

# Click on the multiselect to activate it
multiselect = multiselects[multiselect_index]
multiselect.click()
time.sleep(0.5)

# Now find the input field within this multiselect
address_field = multiselect.query_selector('input.multiselect__input')
```

**Benefits**:
- âœ… Works with hidden input fields
- âœ… Correctly identifies pickup vs destination
- âœ… Activates the multiselect before typing
- âœ… More robust and reliable

## Testing

### Test Results

All tests pass:
```bash
$ python3 run_tests.py
================================================== 32 passed in 0.42s ==================================================
```

### Manual Testing

**Test Case 1: NME Code Resolution**
```
Input: "NME"
Expected: Resolves to "Metro Trains North Melbourne Maintenance Depot"
Result: âœ… PASS - Partial match with "NMED"
```

**Test Case 2: Destination Address Filling**
```
Input: "CPS03O"
Expected: Fills destination field with "CPS Metro Trains Calder Park Depot"
Result: âœ… PASS - Multiselect activated, field filled, dropdown selected
```

## Expected Behavior Now

### Console Output

**Before (with errors)**:
```
WARNING - No address found for code 'NME', using as-is
INFO - Filling Pickup Address: NME
INFO - Pickup Address selected from dropdown
INFO - Filling Destination Address: CPS Metro Trains Calder Park Depot
ERROR - Error filling Destination Address: Timeout
ERROR - Error during booking creation: Timeout
```

**After (fixed)**:
```
INFO - Resolved 'NME' to 'Metro Trains North Melbourne Maintenance Depot' (partial match with 'NMED')
INFO - Resolved 'CPS03O' to 'CPS Metro Trains Calder Park Depot'
INFO - Pickup: Metro Trains North Melbourne Maintenance Depot
INFO - Destination: CPS Metro Trains Calder Park Depot
INFO - Date: 2025-09-04 00:00:00, Time: 02:09
INFO - Filling Pickup Address: Metro Trains North Melbourne Maintenance Depot
INFO - Pickup Address selected from dropdown
INFO - Filling Destination Address: CPS Metro Trains Calder Park Depot
INFO - Destination Address selected from dropdown
INFO - Setting date: 04/09/2025, time: 02:09
INFO - Date and time filled successfully
INFO - Clicking Next button...
INFO - Successfully completed booking form step 2
```

## Browser Behavior

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Pickup Address**:
   - Clicks on first multiselect container
   - Input field becomes visible
   - Types "Metro Trains North Melbourne Maintenance Depot"
   - Dropdown appears with matching addresses
   - Selects first option
   - âœ… Success

2. **Destination Address**:
   - Clicks on second multiselect container
   - Input field becomes visible (was hidden before)
   - Types "CPS Metro Trains Calder Park Depot"
   - Dropdown appears with matching addresses
   - Selects first option
   - âœ… Success

3. **Date and Time**:
   - Fills date: "04/09/2025"
   - Fills time: "02:09"
   - âœ… Success

4. **Next Button**:
   - Waits for button to become enabled
   - Clicks Next
   - âœ… Success

## Partial Matching Examples

The new partial matching logic helps with these cases:

| Excel Code | Matches | Resolved Address |
|------------|---------|------------------|
| NME | NMED | Metro Trains North Melbourne Maintenance Depot |
| CPS | CPS (exact) | Metro Trains Calder Park Depot |
| FSS | FSS (exact) | Metro Trains Flinders St Station Taxi Pick Up |
| PKE | PKE (exact) | Metro Trains Pakenham East Depot Taxi Pick Up |
| BAY | BAY (exact) | BAY Metro Trains Bayswater Workshop |

**Note**: Partial matching only activates if:
- No exact match is found
- Input code is at least 3 characters long
- A code in the database starts with the input

## Edge Cases Handled

### Case 1: Multiple Partial Matches
**Scenario**: "CPS" could match "CPS", "CPS03O", "CPS01B", etc.

**Behavior**: Returns the first match found (usually the shortest/most general)

**Example**:
```
Input: "CPS"
Matches: "CPS" (exact match)
Result: "Metro Trains Calder Park Depot"
```

### Case 2: Short Codes (< 3 chars)
**Scenario**: Input is "NM" (only 2 characters)

**Behavior**: Skips partial matching, uses code as-is

**Reason**: Avoid false matches (e.g., "NM" could match many codes)

### Case 3: No Match Found
**Scenario**: Input is "XYZ123" (doesn't exist)

**Behavior**: Logs warning, uses code as-is

**Example**:
```
WARNING - No address found for code 'XYZ123', using as-is
INFO - Filling Pickup Address: XYZ123
```

## Troubleshooting

### If NME Still Doesn't Resolve

**Check**:
1. Is `metro-locations.json` in the correct location?
2. Does the file contain "NMED" or similar codes?
3. Check the logs for "Resolved 'NME' to..." message

**Solution**:
- Verify file exists: `ls -la metro-locations.json`
- Check file content: `grep -i "nme" metro-locations.json`
- Ensure code is at least 3 characters

### If Destination Field Still Fails

**Check**:
1. Are there two `.multiselect.address-select` elements on the page?
2. Is the second multiselect the destination field?
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

**Solution**:
- Inspect the page HTML structure
- Verify the multiselect order (pickup first, destination second)
- Check if page structure has changed
