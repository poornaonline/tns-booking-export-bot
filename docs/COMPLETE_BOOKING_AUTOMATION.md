## Technical Details

### New Automation Steps

#### Step 3: Intermediate Page

After clicking Next on the address/date/time form:

```python
# Wait for intermediate page to load
time.sleep(3)  # 3 second wait for page to fully load

# Click Next button (no fields to fill on this page)
next_button = self.page.wait_for_selector('button:has-text("Next"):not([disabled])', timeout=10000)
next_button.click()
time.sleep(2)  # Wait for next page
```

#### Step 4: Fill "Metro" Field

After the intermediate page:

```python
# Wait for form to load
time.sleep(3)  # 3 second wait for page to fully load

# Fill input-163 with "Metro"
input_field = self.page.wait_for_selector('#input-163', timeout=10000)
input_field.click()
input_field.fill('')
input_field.type('Metro', delay=100)

# Click Next
next_button = self.page.wait_for_selector('button:has-text("Next"):not([disabled])', timeout=10000)
next_button.click()
time.sleep(2)  # Wait for final form
```

#### Step 5: Final Confirmation

After filling Metro:

```python
# Wait for final form
time.sleep(2)

# Click Book button
book_button = self.page.wait_for_selector('button:has-text("Book"):not([disabled])', timeout=10000)
book_button.click()

# Wait for confirmation
time.sleep(2)
```

### Logging

The automation provides detailed logging at each step:

```
INFO - Clicking Next button to proceed to step 3...
INFO - Successfully completed booking form step 2 (Address/Date/Time)
INFO - Waiting for step 3 (intermediate page) to load...
INFO - Step 3 page loaded, clicking Next button...
INFO - Successfully clicked Next button on step 3
INFO - Successfully completed step 3 (intermediate page)
INFO - Waiting for step 4 form to load...
INFO - Step 4 page loaded, filling input-163 with 'Metro'...
INFO - Successfully filled 'Metro' in input-163
INFO - Clicking Next button after filling Metro...
INFO - Successfully clicked Next button after step 4
INFO - Successfully completed step 4 (Metro field)
INFO - Waiting for final page with Book button...
INFO - Clicking Book button to complete booking...
INFO - Successfully clicked Book button
INFO - Booking creation completed successfully!
```

### Error Handling

Each step includes error handling:

- If input-163 cannot be found, an error is logged and the process stops
- If Next button is not enabled, the automation waits up to 10 seconds
- If Book button is not found, an error is logged
- All errors are reported to the user via the GUI

## Configuration

### Customizing the "Metro" Value

If you need to change the value entered in the input-163 field:

1. Open `src/web/automation.py`
2. Find line ~265: `input_field.type('Metro', delay=100)`
3. Change `'Metro'` to your desired value

### Adjusting Wait Times

If the forms load slower on your system:

1. Open `src/web/automation.py`
2. Adjust the `time.sleep()` values:
   - Line ~262: `time.sleep(3)` - Wait for step 3 form
   - Line ~280: `time.sleep(2)` - Wait for final form
   - Line ~290: `time.sleep(2)` - Wait for confirmation

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Error filling input-163"

**Possible causes:**
- The form structure has changed
- The input field has a different ID
- The page hasn't fully loaded

**Solutions:**
1. Increase the wait time before step 3 (change `time.sleep(3)` to `time.sleep(5)`)
2. Check the browser console for the actual input field ID
3. Update the selector in the code if the ID has changed

### Issue: "Error clicking Book button"

**Possible causes:**
- The Book button is disabled
- Required fields are not filled
- The button text has changed

**Solutions:**
1. Check the browser to see if any fields are missing
2. Verify that all previous steps completed successfully
3. Check the logs for any errors in earlier steps

### Issue: Booking not created

**Possible causes:**
- Network issues
- Form validation errors
- Browser session expired

**Solutions:**
1. Check the browser for error messages
2. Verify your login session is still active
3. Check the logs for detailed error information
4. Try creating a booking manually to verify the form works

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (Manual Steps Required)

```
‚úÖ Step 1: Driver name (automated)
‚úÖ Step 2: Address, date, time (automated)
‚ùå Step 3: Intermediate page (manual)
‚ùå Step 4: Additional details (manual)
‚ùå Step 5: Click Book (manual)
```

User had to manually:
- Click Next on intermediate page
- Fill additional form fields
- Click Next button
- Click Book button

### After (Fully Automated)

```
‚úÖ Step 1: Driver name (automated)
‚úÖ Step 2: Address, date, time (automated)
‚úÖ Step 3: Intermediate page (automated) ‚ú® NEW
‚úÖ Step 4: Additional details (automated) ‚ú® NEW
‚úÖ Step 5: Click Book (automated) ‚ú® NEW
```

Everything is automated - just click "Start Processing Bookings" and wait!
