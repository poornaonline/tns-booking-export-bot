# Excel File Selection Fix - README

## üéØ What Was Fixed

The application now correctly displays and processes the Excel file that you select using the "Select Booking File" button.

### The Problem
When you selected an Excel file, the booking table would show "N/A" for all fields (Date, Time, Driver, From, To), making it appear as if the wrong file was loaded or no data was available.

### The Solution
Fixed a **key mismatch** in the code where the GUI was looking for data using the wrong dictionary keys. The Excel processor returns data with capitalized keys (`Date`, `Time`, etc.), but the GUI was trying to access them with lowercase keys (`date`, `time`, etc.).

## ‚úÖ What Works Now

1. **File Selection**: When you click "Select Booking File" and choose an Excel file, that exact file is read and processed
2. **Data Display**: The booking table correctly shows all data from your selected file
3. **Booking Creation**: The web automation uses data from your selected file
4. **Logging**: Comprehensive logs track which file is being used at every step

## üß™ Testing the Fix

### Quick Test (Automated)

Run these test scripts to verify everything works:

```bash
# Test 1: Basic file reading
python3 test_file_selection.py

# Test 2: Complete data flow
python3 test_data_flow.py
```

Both should show ‚úÖ **PASSED**.

### Manual Test (GUI)

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

2. Click **"Select Booking File"**

3. Choose an Excel file (e.g., `sample_booking_data.xlsx`)

4. **Verify the booking table shows data**:
   - ‚úÖ Date column: Should show dates like "04/09/2025"
   - ‚úÖ Time column: Should show times like "02:09"
   - ‚úÖ Driver column: Should show names like "MAJCEN Dennis"
   - ‚úÖ From column: Should show locations like "NME"
   - ‚úÖ To column: Should show locations like "CPS03O"
   - ‚úÖ Status column: Should show "Pending"

5. **If you see "N/A" in these columns**, the fix didn't work - check the troubleshooting section below

## üìã How to Verify Which File Is Being Used

### Check the Logs

Open the log file: `logs/tns_uploader_YYYYMMDD.log`

Look for these entries (they show the exact file path being used):

```
INFO - User selected file: /path/to/your/file.xlsx
INFO - File path stored in self.selected_file_path: /path/to/your/file.xlsx
INFO - Starting background thread to process file: /path/to/your/file.xlsx
INFO - _process_excel_file called with file_path: /path/to/your/file.xlsx
INFO - Reading Excel file: /path/to/your/file.xlsx
INFO - Successfully read Excel file with 102 rows
INFO - Data processing completed: 96 valid rows, 6 invalid rows
```

When you click "Start Processing Bookings":

```
INFO - Starting booking creation with file: /path/to/your/file.xlsx
INFO - Number of bookings in processed_data: 96
```

These logs confirm that the correct file is being used throughout the entire process.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: GUI still shows "N/A" values

**Possible causes**:

1. **Excel file format issue**:
   - Make sure your Excel file has these columns: `Date`, `Time`, `Driver`, `From`, `To`, `Reason`, `Shift`
   - Column names are case-insensitive, but they must be present

2. **Check the logs**:
   - Look for errors in `logs/tns_uploader_YYYYMMDD.log`
   - Common errors:
     - `"Column validation failed"` - Your Excel file has wrong column names
     - `"Failed to read Excel file"` - File is corrupted or not a valid Excel file

3. **Verify the fix was applied**:
   - Open `src/gui/main_window.py`
   - Go to line 493 (in the `_on_file_processed` method)
   - It should say: `date_str = booking.get('Date', 'N/A')` with capital 'D'
   - If it says `booking.get('date', 'N/A')` with lowercase 'd', the fix wasn't applied

4. **Run the test scripts**:
   ```bash
   python3 test_file_selection.py
   python3 test_data_flow.py
   ```
   - If these fail, there's an issue with the fix

### Problem: Booking creation doesn't work

1. **Make sure the browser is open first**:
   - Click "Open iCabbi Portal"
   - Log in to the portal
   - Then click "Start Processing Bookings"

2. **Check that data is loaded**:
   - The booking table should show data before you click "Start Processing Bookings"
   - If the table is empty, the file wasn't processed correctly

3. **Check the logs**:
   - Look for: `"Starting booking creation with file: <path>"`
   - This confirms which file is being used

## üìä Test Results

All tests pass:

```
‚úÖ test_file_selection.py - PASSED
‚úÖ test_data_flow.py - PASSED
‚úÖ tests/test_excel.py - 19/19 tests PASSED
```

## üéì Technical Details (For Developers)

### The Key Mismatch

**Excel Processor** (`src/excel/processor.py`) returns:
```python
{
    'Date': '4/9/2025',           # Capitalized ‚úÖ
    'Time': '02:09',              # Capitalized ‚úÖ
    'Driver': 'MAJCEN Dennis',    # Capitalized ‚úÖ
    'From': 'NME',                # Capitalized ‚úÖ
    'To': 'CPS03O',               # Capitalized ‚úÖ
    ...
}
```

**GUI Code** (`src/gui/main_window.py`) was using:
```python
date_str = booking.get('date', 'N/A')    # lowercase ‚ùå (before fix)
date_str = booking.get('Date', 'N/A')    # Capitalized ‚úÖ (after fix)
```

### The Fix

Changed lines 493-499 in `src/gui/main_window.py` from lowercase to capitalized keys:

| Field | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Date | `'date'` | `'Date'` ‚úÖ |
| Time | `'time'` | `'Time'` ‚úÖ |
| Driver | `'driver'` | `'Driver'` ‚úÖ |
| From | `'from'` | `'From'` ‚úÖ |
| To | `'to'` | `'To'` ‚úÖ |

## üìù Summary

‚úÖ **The fix is complete and tested**

Your application now:
1. ‚úÖ Correctly reads the Excel file you select
2. ‚úÖ Displays data from that file in the GUI
3. ‚úÖ Uses that data for booking creation
4. ‚úÖ Logs the file path at every step for verification
5. ‚úÖ Maintains data consistency across all components

The issue was **not** that the wrong file was being loaded. The correct file was always being loaded, but the GUI couldn't access the data due to the key mismatch. This has now been fixed.

## üÜò Need Help?

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. Run the test scripts and share the output
2. Check the logs in `logs/tns_uploader_YYYYMMDD.log`
3. Verify your Excel file has the correct column structure
4. Make sure you're using the latest version of the code with the fix applied
