# Address, Date, and Time Automation

## Overview

The TNS Booking Uploader Bot now automatically fills in the Pickup Address, Destination Address, Date, and Time fields in the iCabbi booking form. This document explains how the automation works and how to use it.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Address Resolution from Short Codes

The system can resolve location short codes to full addresses using the `metro-locations.json` file.

**How it works:**
- Reads the "From" and "To" columns from the Excel file
- If the value is a short code (e.g., "NME", "FSS"), looks it up in `metro-locations.json`
- If the value is already a full address (contains spaces or commas), uses it as-is
- Returns the full address for form filling

**Example:**
```
Excel: From = "NME"
Resolved: "Metro Trains North Melbourne Maintenance Depot"

Excel: From = "123 Main Street, Melbourne"
Resolved: "123 Main Street, Melbourne" (used as-is)
```

### 2. Intelligent Address Field Filling

The automation fills address fields with autocomplete support:

**Process:**
1. Clicks the address field to focus it
2. Types the address with a 100ms delay between keystrokes
3. Waits for the autocomplete dropdown to appear
4. Selects the first matching option from the dropdown
5. Continues even if dropdown selection fails

**Fields handled:**
- **Pickup Address**: From the "From" column
- **Destination Address**: From the "To" column

### 3. Date and Time Handling

The system handles various date and time formats from Excel:

**Date formats supported:**
- `dd/mm/yyyy` (e.g., "04/09/2025")
- `yyyy-mm-dd` (e.g., "2025-09-04")
- `dd-mm-yyyy` (e.g., "04-09-2025")
- `mm/dd/yyyy` (e.g., "09/04/2025")
- Excel datetime objects

**Time formats supported:**
- `HH:MM` (24-hour format, e.g., "14:30")
- `H:MM` (e.g., "9:30")
- Excel datetime objects

**Process:**
1. Converts Excel date/time to appropriate string format
2. Fills the date field (handles readonly attribute)
3. Fills the time field with proper formatting
4. Waits for form validation

## Technical Implementation

### Metro Locations Lookup

The `metro-locations.json` file contains an array of location objects:

```json
[
  {
    "shortCode": ["NME", "NMED", "NMEP23", "MYD", "MYD001", ...],
    "address": "Metro Trains North Melbourne Maintenance Depot"
  },
  ...
]
```

**Lookup algorithm:**
1. Convert input code to uppercase
2. Search through all location objects
3. Check if code matches any shortCode in the array
4. Return the corresponding address
5. If no match, return the original code

### Code Structure

#### New Methods in `WebAutomation` class:

1. **`_load_metro_locations()`**
   - Loads metro-locations.json on initialization
   - Returns list of location dictionaries
   - Handles file not found gracefully

2. **`_resolve_address(location_code: str) -> str`**
   - Resolves short codes to full addresses
   - Detects if input is already a full address
   - Returns resolved address or original input

3. **`_fill_address_field(address: str, is_pickup: bool)`**
   - Fills pickup or destination address field
   - Handles autocomplete dropdown selection
   - Waits for dropdown to populate
   - Selects first matching option

4. **`_fill_date_time(booking_date, booking_time)`**
   - Converts various date/time formats
   - Handles Excel datetime objects
   - Fills date and time fields
   - Removes readonly attribute when needed

### Updated `start_booking_creation()` Method

The method now performs these steps:

1. **Step 1: Name Entry** (existing)
   - Fill driver name
   - Click Next button
   - Wait for next page

2. **Step 2: Address, Date, Time** (new)
   - Extract From/To/Date/Time from Excel
   - Resolve addresses using metro locations
   - Fill pickup address with autocomplete
   - Fill destination address with autocomplete
   - Fill date and time fields
   - Click Next button

## Usage

### Excel File Format

Your Excel file should have these columns:

| Date | Time | Driver | From | To | Reason | Shift |
|------|------|--------|------|-----|--------|-------|
| 04/09/2025 | 14:30 | MAJCEN Dennis | NME | FSS | Business | Day |
| 05/09/2025 | 09:00 | SMITH John | 123 Main St | PKE | Meeting | Morning |

**Column details:**
- **From**: Short code (e.g., "NME") or full address
- **To**: Short code (e.g., "FSS") or full address
- **Date**: Any common date format
- **Time**: 24-hour format (HH:MM)

### Running the Automation

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

2. **Follow the workflow:**
   - Click "Open iCabbi Portal"
   - Click "Select Booking File" and choose your Excel file
   - Click "Start Processing Bookings"

3. **Automation sequence:**
   - ✅ Navigates to create booking page
   - ✅ Fills driver name
   - ✅ Clicks Next
   - ✅ Fills pickup address (with autocomplete)
   - ✅ Fills destination address (with autocomplete)
   - ✅ Fills date
   - ✅ Fills time
   - ✅ Clicks Next
   - ⏸️ Leaves browser open for manual continuation

## Error Handling

The automation includes comprehensive error handling:

### Address Resolution Errors
- **Short code not found**: Uses the code as-is and logs a warning
- **Metro locations file missing**: Continues with codes as-is
- **Invalid JSON**: Logs error and continues

### Form Filling Errors
- **Dropdown not appearing**: Continues with typed address
- **Field not found**: Logs error and raises exception
- **Timeout errors**: Caught and logged with details

### Date/Time Errors
- **Invalid date format**: Uses original value as string
- **Readonly field**: Removes attribute programmatically
- **Parsing errors**: Falls back to string representation

## Logging

The automation logs all important steps:

```
INFO - Resolved 'NME' to 'Metro Trains North Melbourne Maintenance Depot'
INFO - Filling Pickup Address: Metro Trains North Melbourne Maintenance Depot
INFO - Pickup Address selected from dropdown
INFO - Filling Destination Address: FSS Metro Trains Flinders St Station Taxi Pick Up
INFO - Destination Address selected from dropdown
INFO - Setting date: 04/09/2025, time: 14:30
INFO - Date and time filled successfully
INFO - Clicking Next button...
INFO - Successfully completed booking form step 2
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Address not found in dropdown

**Cause**: The address might not match any options in the autocomplete

**Solution**:
1. Check if the short code exists in `metro-locations.json`
2. Verify the address spelling matches the portal's database
3. Try using a full address instead of a short code

### Issue: Date field not accepting input

**Cause**: The date picker might require specific interaction

**Solution**:
1. Check the date format in Excel (should be dd/mm/yyyy)
2. Ensure the date is valid and not in the past
3. The automation removes readonly attribute - check browser console for errors

### Issue: Time field shows "ASAP" instead of time

**Cause**: The time field might have special handling for empty values

**Solution**:
1. Ensure time is in HH:MM format (24-hour)
2. Check that the time value is not empty in Excel
3. Verify the time is valid (00:00 to 23:59)

### Issue: Dropdown selection fails

**Cause**: Dropdown might take longer to load or have different structure

**Solution**:
1. The automation continues even if dropdown fails
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Increase wait times in the code if needed

## Testing

All tests pass successfully:

```bash
$ python3 run_tests.py
================================================== 32 passed in 0.41s ==================================================
```
