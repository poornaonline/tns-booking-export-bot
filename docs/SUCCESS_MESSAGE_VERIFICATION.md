# Success Message Verification - Accurate Booking Status

## Version 2.9.5 - Verify Booking Success with Confirmation Message

### 🎯 Problem

After clicking "Book now", the automation waited 5 seconds and assumed the booking was successful. However, there was **no verification** that the booking actually succeeded. If the booking failed (validation error, network issue, etc.), it would still be marked as "Done" ✅.

**Issue**: No way to know if booking actually succeeded or failed.

---

## ✅ Solution

After clicking "Book now", **wait for the success message** to appear:

1. **Click "Book now" button**
2. **Wait up to 10 seconds** for success message
3. **Look for text**: "Your booking has been created"
4. **If found** → Return `True` (booking succeeded) ✅
5. **If not found** → Return `False` (booking failed) ❌

### How It Works

**Before (Unreliable)** ❌:
```python
book_button.click()
time.sleep(5)  # Just wait 5 seconds
return True    # Assume success ❌
```

**After (Reliable)** ✅:
```python
book_button.click()

# Wait for success message (up to 10 seconds)
success_message = page.wait_for_selector(
    'text="Your booking has been created"',
    timeout=10000
)

if success_message:
    return True   # ✅ Confirmed success!
else:
    return False  # ❌ Failed
```

```
booking_failed_20250930_191632.png
```

See exactly what was on screen when it failed.

### Step 3: Identify Issue

Common issues:
- **Invalid date format** → Fix Excel data
- **Invalid address** → Check address codes
